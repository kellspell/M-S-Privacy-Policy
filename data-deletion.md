## How to Request Deletion

You can request the permanent deletion of your account and data directly from within the app:

2.  Go to your **Profile** or **Settings** menu.
3.  Tap on **"Account"** or **"Privacy"**.
4.  Select the option for **"Delete Account"**.
5.  Follow the on-screen instructions to confirm your choice.

**Contact Email for Deletion Requests:** [kellspell.org@gmail.com](mailto:kellspell.org@gmail.com)

## What Happens When You Delete Your Account

Upon confirming your account deletion request:

*   **Your profile, including your name, photo, and bio, is permanently erased.**
*   **All your messages and chat histories are permanently deleted from our active servers.**
*   **Your account login credentials are disabled and removed.**

**Deletion is permanent and irreversible.** Once your account is deleted, you will not be able to recover any of your data or reactivate the account.

## Data Retention Period

After you initiate the deletion process, your account and all associated personal data will be completely and permanently removed from our systems within **30 days**.

This short retention period is for security purposes (e.g., to finalize operations or to prevent accidental deletion) and to allow for the process to complete across all our systems. After this period, no personal data is kept.
