# Mothers&Sisters Safety Standards

At Mothers&Sisters, the safety and well-being of our users, especially minors, is our highest priority. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). These standards outline our practices for preventing, detecting, and reporting such material.

## 1. Prohibited Content & Behavior
Mothers&Sisters strictly prohibits any content that constitutes or facilitates child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). This includes, but is not limited to:
- Child sexual abuse material (CSAM).
- Grooming, predatory, or exploitative behavior towards minors.
- Sharing sexually explicit content with minors.
- Creating, seeking, or sharing imagery of minors in a sexualized context.

Any user found violating these terms will be immediately banned from the platform, and their activity will be reported to the relevant authorities.

## 2. User Reporting
We provide users with easy, accessible tools to report any content or behavior that raises child safety concerns.
- **In-App Reporting**: Users can report suspicious profiles or conversations directly within the Mothers&Sisters app. All reports are reviewed by our team on a high-priority basis.
- **External Reporting**: Concerns can also be sent via email to our dedicated safety team at [kellspell.org@gmail.com](mailto:kellspell.org@gmail.com).

## 3. Designated Point of Contact
Mothers&Sisters has a designated safety team responsible for addressing CSAE concerns and ensuring compliance with legal obligations.

**Contact Email:** [kellspell.org@gmail.com](mailto:kellspell.org@gmail.com)

This point of contact is equipped to speak about our CSAM prevention practices and compliance with relevant laws. We prioritize responding to and acting upon all legitimate safety reports.

## 4. Compliance with Laws
Mothers&Sisters complies with all applicable regional and national laws regarding child safety and the mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse material. We report instances of CSAM to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)](https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline) via their CyberTipline and to other relevant national authorities as required by law.

## 5. Prevention & Education
We are committed to proactively preventing harm through:
- **Clear Guidelines**: Publishing and enforcing these safety standards.
